This is a file to test the transpiler from WikiText to HTML.

== Basics ==

As you can see, ''headings'' work and '''formatting''' as well. Even '''com''plex''' struc''tures work:

== References ==

You found something smart? Better but a <ref>Reference to a source</ref> on it.

Named <ref name="refname">That's true!</ref> references are allowed, too.
They even can be reused<ref name="refname" />.

A refname can have arbitrary characters as well<ref name=".,-+3/Ü´_">That's cool!</ref>.

Refs with some other attributes are okay, too<ref some="other/attributes">No name, no problem.</ref>.

== Templates ==

Some get ignored (due to layout reasons or low significance for an ebook) but some work like the ''grcS'' template used in the German [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stern Stern] article: {{grcS|ἀστήρ, ἄστρον|astēr, astron}}.

== Links ==

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As As] [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/you you] [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/can can] [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/see see], links work as well.

=== Interwiki links ===

Some links lead to other [[:de:Wikipedia|Wikipedia]] instances.

== Math ==
Let us do some <math>m \cdot a + t - \mathbb{H}</math> stuff:

:<math>
\begin{align}
\rho - 1 &= \sqrt{5} \\
\rho &= \sqrt{5} + 1 \\
\rho &> 1
\end{align}
</math>

== Lists ==

We can do lists as well.

=== Unordered lists ===

Yummi:

* apple
* banana

=== Ordered lists ===

How to go shopping:

# Go to the store
# Buy stuff
# ...
# Profit

=== Description list ===

Mostly used for indention without bullet-points or numbers:

: first line
: second line

A more complex example:

* Mixed lists
*# and nest them
*#* like this
*#*; definitions
*#*: work:
*#*; apple
*#*; banana
*#*: fruits

== Images ==

We can embed images:

[[Datei:Wikimedia_Servers-0051_19.jpg|mini|With some caption.]]

Or embed the image inline like this [[Datei:Wikipedia-logo-v2.svg|16px]] Wikipedia icon.

All (raster) images will be scaled down and turned into grayscale images. SVGs stay as they are. Some media types (like mp4 and gif) are not supported.

=== Galleries ===

<gallery>
Wikimedia_Servers-0051_19.jpg|With some caption.
Datei:Wikipedia-logo-v2.svg
</gallery>

=== Image maps ===

<imagemap>
Image:Wikimedia_Servers-0051_19.jpg|With some caption
rect 1 1 741 445 [[Oregon|Oregon]]
desc none
</imagemap>

== Tables ==

A bit tricky but they work as well:

{| class="wikitable"
|+ Some heading
|-
! Heading A !! Heading Bee
|-
| Important value: [[Datei:Wikipedia-logo-v2.svg|mini|64px|Images in tables work as well]] || Even more important value
|-
| This row is ...
| ...multi-line wikitext
|-
| Not so important value ||
{| class="wikitable"
|+ Even inner tables work
|-
! Col 1 !! Col 2
|-
| This col ... || ... is cool
|-
| Foo
| Bar
|}
|}

== References ==

They will be collected and are visible at the end of the document:<br>

<references />

== Mixing stuff ==

1. Mixing stuff also works:
2. Planemo = '''''plane'''tary [https://object.de '''m'''ass] '''o'''bject''
